## Also Note:
This isn't my best work and it was rushed. Its all in a bat file and for windows only. My reason for making this program is that I wanted something simular but didn't find such tool on the web. So I made one and made it available for the community. You can modify this tool as much as you want but if your going to republish it please give credit.
